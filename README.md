# Inverse-Fast-Fourier-Transform

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of
a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). DFT is used to convert a signal from time domain to frequency
domain while vice versa is true for IDFT.

Here we implement IFFT using Python and write verification system using MATLAB.
